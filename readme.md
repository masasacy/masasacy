# Masasacy (مساساسي): An Arabic language-learning web app



## About
Masasacy (مساساسي) is an Arabic language-learning web app. We built this as an open-source, non-profit project and are still in the early development phase.  

This little project has a big dream: Encourage people to fulfill their sincere intention of becoming better Muslims by understanding Arabic vocabulary used in their daily prayers, dhikr, and more.

## Feature
We're planning to deliver free Arabic language-learning materials that are divided into topics like:
1. Ramadhan
2. Shahada
3. (to be updated, insyaallah)

Inside each topic, there is at least 1 lesson containing:
1. **Arabic text** = Arabic word or sentence to learn
2. **Translation** = Currently, we can provide translation in English and Indonesian
3. **Explanation** = How to use that Arabic text, note, or anything related to it
4. **References** = We're still learners. So, References is a section where we put links to articles or videos we learned from to explain the Arabic text in this web app. Useful too for anyone who is eager to learn more

For now, the very first feature we want to provide is "**Learn**", where we can read materials on topics we are interested to learn. Hopefully, someday we can provide a "**Practice**" feature too, aimed at practicing what we've learned by answering quizzes. May Allah make it easy for us to still develop this project.



## History
Assalaamu'alaikum. Hi there! I'm Sasa, the founder of this project. If you want to know the history of why this project exists, kindly read what I wrote below.

Everything started on March 3, 2024, when an old dream of mine popped out: Developing a web for learning the Arabic language. 

But what makes my web different form Arabic language-learning websites or apps out there? I lifted up my problem, maybe also a common problem of Muslims: "I didn't understand the meaning of words I say on my daily prayers, dhikr, or when reciting the Qur'an. Same words are used again and again, but I just guessing what it means." 

I believe that if we understand Arabic, it would be easier for us to understand the Qur'an, sunnah, and everything related to our deen: Islam.

Days even years before that day, I lived my life as a generalist. I worked in various roles and various fields. Being a generalist isn't bad, sure. I just want to have at least 1 or 2 fields I love to pursue for the rest of my life. And at that moment, web development looked so interesting.

I started doing research. I shared my progress publicly on Instagram and LinkedIn. Tried to develop the web by myself. Discussed with many of my online friends. Until I realized that, the fields that I'm looking for are language and education.

I can't say I'm good at language learning. Not even fluent in the languages I'm learning right now. Not a good teacher either (I ever worked as a freelance private teacher for kids, didn't put it on LinkedIn because I forgot the specific time range of that experience). But I decided to focus on it, redefining the goals of my future.

So that's why now I open volunteering opportunities for designers & developers out there who are willing to join and work together to make this project live.



## Volunteer opportunities
We're working remotely, with asynchronous communications (no online meetings). This project may be suitable for you who love working culture like that and are looking for volunteering experience in working on a real project, that focuses on the Arabic language and education fields.

Then what are the benefits you'll get?

I can't promise anything. Currently, we are building this as a free web app, non-profit, and open-source project, so we don't get paid for it. May Allah grant rewards to everyone who is willing to contribute.

I just can give you permission to:
- Mention this project on your LinkedIn, Instagram, or other social media profiles to showcase your experience
- Explain this project on your portfolio file or website

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on Instagram or Telegram @masasacy

Jazaakumullaahu khayran.
